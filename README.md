Fxex
====

**Description**
The prodigal son of an earlier repository I have on github called fxerl.
Elixir is much easier to get up and running with a working application

**Usage**

```git clone http://github.com/arthurcolle/fxex```

```cd fxex```

```mix deps.get```

```mix compile```

```iex -S mix run```

```iex> Fxex.usd "EUR"```

```iex> Fxex.usd "GBP"```

```iex> Fxex.usd "JPY"```
